iCG Project - Teaching/Learning Computer Science into the Internet
http://www.matematica.br/icg

iCG is a system to present basic concepts of computer and high level
languages, implemented in Java (application and applet).

With iCG is possible to introduce concepts of Computers. The iCG presents a very
simple model of a digital Computer. It can demostrate how a computer
works and how is possible to build a compiler to it.

iCG has 2 main interfaces, the Emulator interface and the Compiler interface.
The Emulator is a visual abstraction of the Computer itself, with its main
devices (e.g., memory, acumulator and input/output devices) and a few machine
instructions. The Compiler is intended to provide to the student a real
feeling about how to translate code in high level language into a machine
level language.

This project was started in 2003 as an undergraduate project to a course I
taught Data Structures to Computer Science at Institute of Mathematics and
Statistics at University of S<E3>o Paulo (IME-USP).

The iCG implements iLM (interactive Learning Modules) protocol, allowing its
incorporation to an LMS (Learning Managmente System). Our research group
also implements a Moodle package, named iAssign, to incorporate iLM to
Moodle. The iAssing to Moodle 1.9 is available in http://www.matematica.br/ia,
and the version to Moodle 2.X and 3.X is available (including in Moodle.org).

To run iCG using English language, please use command line with: java -jar iCG.jar lang=en_US
